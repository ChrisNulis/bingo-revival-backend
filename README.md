*ABOUT
=================
This project was originally developed by myself and two other developers. Due to its age and the discontinuation of Herokuâ€™s free tier membership, the project was no longer maintained. I am now reviving this project on my own.

My objective is to enhance the existing codebase without altering the design or functionality. I plan to restructure the code to improve efficiency and adopt more modern practices. Currently, the backend is still under construction and will be hosted on a local server rather than Heroku.

*HOW TO VIEW THE BACKEND
========================
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ChrisNulis/bingo-revival-backend.git
2. Navigate into the project directory: cd bingo-revival-backend
3. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv myenv source myenv/bin/activate (MacOS) myenv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
4. Install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run Migrations to set up database schema: python manage.py migrate
6. Run the Development Server: python manage.py runserver
7. The server will start and be accessible at http://localhost:8000/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
